# Unsafe Rust Pointer Modification
This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe code and pointer manipulation.  Modifying a vector's contents through a raw pointer without proper handling can lead to unpredictable behavior. The `bug.rs` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a safer, more idiomatic Rust approach.

## Problem
Directly modifying a vector's internal data using `as_mut_ptr()` and unsafe blocks can easily lead to memory corruption or runtime panics if the vector's internal structure is not managed correctly. The example in `bug.rs` illustrates this potential pitfall. 

## Solution
The recommended solution is to avoid unsafe operations whenever possible.  If you need to work with low-level memory manipulation, thoroughly understand the underlying memory model and use safer Rust constructs whenever practical.  The corrected code in `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates a more reliable way to modify vector elements.
